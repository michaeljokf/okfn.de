      <description>&amp;ldquo;Apps and the City&amp;rdquo; was a hackday on local traffic organised by Open Knowledge Foundation Germany together with the local transport provider VBB, the Berlin government, and the FH Potsdam. The VBB released GTFS data, opened up their API and provided some geo datasets about entrances to stations. During the event, coders, software experts, and designers used open transport data to create applications intended to improve public transport non-commercially.</description>

      <title>Code for Germany</title>

      <description>Code For Germany is a network of groups of volunteers (labs) who use their skills to shape their cities and social life. They advocate more transparency, open data and participation in their cities. In particular, they mediate between civil society, administration and politics, and use their skills to improve communication between them. This provides the necessary impetus so that as many people as possible can benefit from open and free digitisation.</description>

      <description>Energyhack is a hackathon around open energy data. Our energy supply and the ways of its generation are manifold. But how is energy distributed and how do we ensure that more information can be exchanged between producers and consumers? Together with developers, designers, and researchers, thought leaders in the energy industry brainstorm ideas, design, and develop prototypes in 24 hours. The data from the Open Data Portal Netzdaten-Berlin was available to the participants as a database.</description>

      <description>In a democracy, it is necessary for citizens to be able to inform themselves freely about government actions. With the Freedom of Information Act, every person, regardless of age or origin, has the right to request documents from the authorities. The FragDenStaat online platform supports citizens in exercising their right to access information from German authorities. Citizens no longer have to work their way through the legal jungle of the federal states and the federal government to make a request.</description>

      <title>Jugend hackt</title>

      <description>Jugend hackt is a program designed to support young coders.
While such competitions as ‘Jugend musiziert’ (music) and ‘Jugend forscht’ (science) have been established in Germany for decades, there are few intiatives directed towards young talent in the field of software development. To fill this gap, Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland, together with a media education agency, Mediale Pfade, organised the first Jugend hackt event in 2013. Since then, it has become a successful and well-established hackathon for young coders from all over Germany.</description>

      <description>The Prototype Fund supports socially relevant software projects and increases their sustainable impact by open sourcing as a principle. In short: We support Public Interest Tech.
We make digital-social innovation possible with developers that bring a wide range of skills in technology design. With up to 47,500 euros per project and team, the Prototype Fund supports software developers, hackers and creatives in building protptypes for tools and applications in the areas of civic tech, data literacy, IT security and software infrastructure.</description>

      <description>edulabs sees itself as a supra-regional incubator in which people use their didactic, technical, and creative skills to develop innovative and re-usable educational materials. The project works on three levels: concept development, provision and advertising of open educational resources as well as community building and support. Throughout Germany, edulabs organises meetings of interdisciplinary teams where open educational resources and digitally supported methods are evaluated, created, documented, and improved. The lab community is supported editorially, didactically, technically, as well as with the organisation of events.</description>
