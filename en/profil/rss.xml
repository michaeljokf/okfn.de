      <description>Digital technologies create new opportunities for civil society: citizens can exercise their rights more easily and obtain better information about what governments are doing. To support fact-based political discourse, we develop software, provide infrastructure, and fund open source projects. We experiment as well as offer a space for experiments to others.</description>

      <description>In a democracy, open knowledge is a prerequisite for participation. We want to see a world in which knowledge is freely available both online and offline. This means that we not only use, but also share, further develop, and change the knowledge that we have. This allows us to create a community that everyone can participate in. To do so, we give talks, run initiatives, and research the impact of open data.</description>

      <description>Only those who understand technology can help shape it. This is why we offer workshops on a wide variety of topics such as data literacy, open data, and open education. We also develop individual educational concepts.</description>
